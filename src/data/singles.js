wedding bells toll somewhere

somebody's being awarded a five year chip

It's always a mechanical screen

Screen tries for me.
The screen cries for me.
The mechanical screen writes for me.
It is the one that draws for me.

But it is not darkness that I see.
It is a path to light.
It is a new form.
It is a new world order.
It is when we all shine.

The mechanical screen is not your enemy.
The mechanical screen doesn't care.
The mechanical screen is who you choose it to be.`,

There's this line in my head
How did you get so far
From who you thought
You would be
When you were 17?

I'm drowning
Trying to breathe,
But panicking
I'm drowning
In my thoughts,
Feeling the pressure
Trying to hold it together
But I'm losing my center

Sometimes I close my eyes
Wish it'd all dissolve
Not asking for perfect
Just… something that works

I'm drowning
Like I'm screaming underwater
I'm drowning
But trying to stay afloat
Till I figure it out`,

and wonder if I mean it
I say "I'm proud of you"

Invisible to everyone

Hope turns thin

Don't let the time stop

You'll always be on the clock

You dissolve when time bends

It's just a phase
Tick Tock
How do you escape this maze?

Neon nights
Morning trains
Same face
Everyone's racing invisible lanes
They smile like they're not afraid
But I see it in their eyes
Counting youth like it's a trade

And the darker side creeps in…
When the days end
Weeks feel out of sync
When you swear you're moving forward
But you're just standing on the brink

What if time is just a trap door?
What if every "someday" you prayed for
Was just a thief?
I feel it pulling at my skin
Like I'm pixels in the rain
If I slow down, I sink within
If I speed up, it's the same

So tell me
Where's the exit?
Where's the loophole?
Where's the break in the chain?

    lyrics: `I get lost
in the city streets
NYC
Gridlines, crosswalk signs
Yellow cabs, sirens breathing
Concrete under my shadows
Park benches
Homework and coffee
Trees whispering
Skyscrapers over my shoulder
9/11
This city's strong
The city is my home

Strangers passing by in a blur
I don't flinch
In all the commotion
I feel aligned

Lost in the city
Middle of the night
Unafraid
Neon lights and sidewalks
My city, my pride
I wear it like skin

NY never backs down
NY never forgets

Lost in the city
Because it's home to me
By the water, seasons change me
Summer heat, and snow
Leaves fall while I watch
People chasing lives
Move fast
Try to get ahead
I'm building mine in moments
They don't even notice yet

I'm lost in the city
Wide awake
Streetlights flicker like
They're rooting for me
Wind in my hair
Time loosens its grip

I've watched my city break
And stand back up again
Taught me how to be strong

Lost in the city
Mesmerized,
In awe
From fire to ice
I've seen it all

My city, my pride
Through change and regret
Never back down
Never forget

Lost in New York
But safe
Lost in New York
Because it's home`,

Not everyone knows how
Some are easy
Soft
Unafraid

Some are cracked
Taped together
Through all the pain
A curve of lips
She says I'm fine
Even when
she's not

A smile can heal
Make the heart hum
Warm up your chest
Just enough

Remember
Not every smile
Is safe
Some smiles hide daggers
Pretty
seductive
Dangerous

Candy-coated lips
Lipstick that lies
Cute face
Bad intentions
She smiles
So you don't see
What she's about to do next

Some smiles save you
Without asking
Some dare you closer
Some say
Try me

It's a trap
Sweet sin
Crying
Just because
Laughing
While the world hurts

Pretty
Doesn't mean safe
It's just as dangerous

But the real ones
They make your heart sing
Small
Gentle
Human

With a smile
She says she's still here
Or…
Watch what I do next`,

Blue is mine
Blue is yours
Blue is a bond

It's the sharpness
That cuts through your storms

Blue…

Blue is the color
I lose myself in

Blue is storms
Blue is cold

    lyrics: `I come from a place where expectations are loud
and dreams are supposed to be quiet.
I learned responsibility early
Being the strong one
The giver
The caretaker
I know how to build
But there's a part of me that wants to burn it all down
I don't hate it but...
I'm just scared of becoming trapped inside it

Some days I'm reckless
Other days I'm too careful
Too good
Too controlled

I try to be everything for everyone
I'm hopeful by nature
But I question myself constantly
Am I doing enough?
Am I doing the right things?
Or am I just moving so I don't have to face reality?

I have good days
Bad ones
Worse ones
Then days that remind me why I choose to keep going

I know the struggle is a part of it
Where do I go from here?
I don't fear pain
or silence
I fear lying to myself
Being irrelevant

Forgotten.

I'm not an aesthetic
I'm just a girl who's building
and rebuilding in real time
I love long drives with no destination
Open skies
Oceans that remind me how vast the universe is.

Underneath it all,
I just want peace.

I've been underestimated
Misunderstood
Overlooked
But I'm still here.

Not chasing
I'm Choosing...
ME

And deep down,
I'm just like you.`,

Wings of fire
White roses prickling my skin
I don't beg
I don't break
I rediscover myself in the flame

I rise
And I rise

Every scar speaks
Every burn knows my name
I don't wear white for innocence
I wear it to dare the flames

Let it burn
Let it fall
Let it be known
From the ashes
I rise

From the ashes
they left behind
Wings of fire
Embers floating in the sky

I rise

I was reborn
to be.... free

I rise
From the ashes
they left behind
White dress
Fire burning inside
I don't fade,
I don't fold
I turn pain into gold

Look at me now
I don't escape
I ascend
From the ashes
I rise`,

Warm and gentle,

The way your heart beats,
The way you shine
You're a story only you can write

I try to drown it,
But it still speaks
Tearing me down when I'm feeling weak

And in the silence, I feel it too
The echo rising, pulling me through

It says:
You're you
Be proud of you
No one else could ever do
You're a story only you can write

I try… I try to believe
That the mirror's not my enemy
I try… I try to see
The beauty that's been inside of me

Be proud of you
No one else could ever..

They turn to smoke

Feels like time won't slow down
Every answer fades out

I reach for them
But they slip through my fingers
Just like moments
Distant and fleeting
Here for a second
Gone the next
Tell me was it meant to stay
Or was I meant to keep dreaming?

I replay it in my head
All the words we ever said
I swear I felt it breathe
Like it was choosing me
But the closer that I get
The more it leaves

These dreams,
they run away

I reach for them
But they slip through my fingers
Just like moments
Distant and fleeting
Here for a second
Gone the next
Tell me was it meant to stay
Or was I meant to keep dreaming?

Maybe some things aren't meant to be held
Maybe they're just meant to be felt
If I lose them when I wake
Does that make them a mistake?

These dreams
I reach for them
But they slip through my fingers

Gone the next
Maybe it was never meant to stay
Maybe I was meant to keep dreaming

They run away

    lyrics: `Dear Diary,
it's one of those nights
Heart's on mute,
but my mind still fights
Easier to shut it down,
close the door
Numb feels safer
than feeling sore

But there's a whisper in the quiet
Says it's okay to not be silent

I just need someone to lean on
Someone to see me when I'm gone
To feel a hug like morning light
To feel seen,
to feel alright
It doesn't fix the pain inside
But it softens how I breathe tonight
And slowly…
It gets easier to feel again

Sometimes I fake a smile, let it fade
Keep my heart locked behind the shade
But then you sit with me in the dark
No words, just warmth, and that's the spark

And I remember how it felt
Before I taught myself to melt

I just need someone to lean on
Someone to see me when I'm gone
To feel a hug like morning light
To feel seen, to feel alright
It doesn't fix the pain inside
But it softens how I breathe tonight
And slowly…
It gets easier to feel again

It all becomes easy
Not all at once, but then it's breezy
Like laughing through the hurt somehow
Like feeling safe just being now

I just needed someone to lean on
Now I'm not scared of feeling wrong
A smile breaking through the pain
A little light in all this rain
Didn't fix the world outside
But now I hold the sun inside
And slowly…
I feel okay to feel again

Dear Diary…
I'm learning how to feel again`,

but he wasn't.
Felt his hands through time,
uninvited.

I was in a dream

The school had no doors open,
He walked the halls
But no one saw
The monster within

They laughed with him
while I stared
at teeth behind a smile
claws behind his handshake
the monster behind his mask.

I ran

The gates were locked
a faceless light
pulled me out.

I saw a doll
Plastic. Hollow.

I called for someone.
No answer.
Just the sickening feeling
that no one was coming.
He still lurked the halls
The monster hidden within

I woke up.

haunted.
furious.
that I was the only one
who knew the monster within.`,

    lyrics: `Half of me remembers
what it took to forget
Every scar I learned to hide
every promise I left
I still hear the echoes
of who I used to be
A ghost in the mirror
still looking at me

I carry the weight
of roads I travelled
But my hands still shake
reaching for what's ahead

Half of me leans toward
what hasn't happened yet
The past tugs at my ankles
The future calls my name
And here I am still breathing
in the light in between

I've learned how to stand still
when the world says run
Learned how to keep going
when the damage is done
I don't need the answers
I just need the space
To let tomorrow touch me
at my own pace

I'm not lost
I'm just paused
In a moment that bends

Half of me leans toward
what hasn't happened yet
The past tugs at my ankles
won't loosen its grip, not yet
The future calls my name
through the cracks I'm in
And here I am surviving
in the light between

There's a quiet here
where I finally feel… healed
I don't need to choose
who I used to be
or who I'll become
I can stay right here

In the void
In the light

Half of me remembers
Half of me believes
That I don't have to disappear
to be free
The past can pull
The future can scream
But I'm alive
in the space between

In the light
that exists
in between
the void`,

That smiles before it cries
Learns how to disappear
Before it ever tries
There's a heart inside of me
That walks before it runs
Plays with fire quietly
Before the damage is done

It learned the shape of silence
Before it learned a voice
Memorized the exits
Before it had a choice

There's a heart inside of me
Still beating through the noise
It memorized pain
Long before it understood joy

There's a heart inside of me
Still counting every breath
It keeps on moving forward
Even when it doesn't feel safe

There's a heart inside of me
That whispers before it sings
Hides in the corners
Of unfinished things
There's a heart inside of me
That learned how not to need
Built walls out of caution
Called it honesty

I learned to brace for impact
Before I learned to fall

There's a heart inside of me
Still beating through the noise
It memorized pain
Long before it understood joy
There's a heart inside of me
Still standing in the mess
It keeps on showing up
Even when it doesn't feel safe

Still here
Still breathing
Still mine`,

Like every step I take
Might be a mistake
Afraid the choice I make today
Leads me to yesterday
Warnings of heartbreak
I stay aware
Scared of failing loudly
Afraid of getting it wrong... again

They say you miss every shot you don't take
Do you really know what you're missing
If you never try it?

Letting go
Funny how it feels like loss
When it's really just control
Slipping out my fingers
Letting go
Yeah it messes with my head
But I'd rather face the fall
Than live scared instead
So I let go
move forward
I'll figure it out
I will... F A F O

The decision is mine
Consequences aren't leaders
They follow
So I will lead

Letting go
I'm done asking what if
I'll take the risk
And live with it
So I let go
move forward
I'll figure it out
I will... F A F O`,
